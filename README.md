# SCRU64: Sortable, Clock-based, Realm-specifically Unique identifier

SCRU64 ID offers compact, time-ordered unique identifiers generated by
distributed nodes. SCRU64 has the following features:

- ~62-bit non-negative integer storable as signed/unsigned 64-bit integer
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 12-digit case-insensitive textual representation (Base36)
- ~38-bit Unix epoch-based timestamp that ensures useful life until year 4261
- Variable-length node/machine ID and counter fields that share 24 bits

```python
# pass node ID through environment variable
import os

os.environ["SCRU64_NODE_SPEC"] = "42/8"

import scru64

# generate a new identifier object
x = scru64.new_sync()
print(x)  # e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt3"
print(int(x))  # as a 64-bit unsigned integer


# generate a textual representation directly
print(scru64.new_string_sync())  # e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt4"
```

See [SCRU64 Specification] for details.

SCRU64's uniqueness is realm-specific, i.e., dependent on the centralized
assignment of node ID to each generator. If you need decentralized, globally
unique time-ordered identifiers, consider [SCRU128].
